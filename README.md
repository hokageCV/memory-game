The objective of the game is to select 5 or 10 images only once, without selecting any image twice. If a user selects an image twice, they lose the game.

## Features

## How to Play
- Choose to play a 5-image game or a 10-image game

- If you select an image twice, you lose the game

## Tips for Success
